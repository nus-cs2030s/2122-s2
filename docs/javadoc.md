# Javadoc

## Why Documentation is Important

One of the goals of CS2030/S is to move you away from the mindset of writing code that you will discard when done with, and that only you and your tutor will read (e.g., in CS1101S missions).  CS2030/S prepares you for working in software engineering teams in many ways, one of which is by getting you to document your code.

`javadoc` is a tool used to document Java code.  It automatically generates HTML documentation from the comments in your code.  The [Java API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html) that you have seen are generated from `javadoc`.

## How to Comment for Javadoc

`javadoc` distinguishes between normal comments and comments meant for `javadoc` by how we "fence" the comments.  A `javadoc` comment always starts with `/**` (note the double asterisks) and ends with `*/` and is always placed _immediately_ before a class, an interface, a constructor, a method, or field declaration.

Example:
```Java
/**
 * Encapsulates a circle on a 2D plane.  The `Circle` class's supported
 * operations include (i) checking if a point is contained in the circle,
 * and (ii) moving the circle around to a new position.
 */
```

The first sentence is the summary sentence.  We should follow some style guidelines when writing the summary sentence (see below).

`javadoc` comments supports HTML tags.  If you are not familiar with HTML,
that is fine.  We will tell you what you need to know below.

## Tags

`javadoc` supports tags.  Here are some tags that we would like you to use:

- `@param <name> <description>`: describe the parameter <name>
- `@param <<name>> <description>`: describe the type parameter <name>
- `@return <description>` describe the return value
- `@throws <class name> <description>` describe what the exception <class name> being thrown and what are the possible reasons

## Style

1. If you want to break your comments into paragraphs, insert one blank line between paragraphs.  Start a new paragraph with HTML tag `<p>` with no space after, and end your paragraph with HTML tag `</p>`.

2. You should use the tags `@param` `@return` and `@throws` in that order, and they should never appear without a description.

3. The summary should be short and succinct.  It may not be a complete sentence, but it should still be capitalized and ends with a period.  E.g., ```/** Encapsulates a circle on 2D plane. .. */```

4. You don't need to write `javadoc` for self-explanatory, simple, obvious, methods.  e.g., `getX()`, unless you want to explain what `x` means.

## How to Generate Javadoc

In its simplest form, you can generate `javadoc` like this:

```
javadoc *.java
```

This will generate the HTML files in your current directory.

To avoid clutters, I recommend that you specify the output directory, e.g.,

```
javadoc *.java -d docs
```

This will generate the documentation and put it under the `docs` subdirectory.

`javadoc` by default generates documents only for public classes, fields, and methods.  To generate documentation for everything, run
```
javadoc *.java -d docs -private
```

If you generate the documentation on your computer, you can view it by opening up the file `index.html` in your browser.
